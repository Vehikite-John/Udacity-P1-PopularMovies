###TODO: update readme
###source of readme template: https://gist.github.com/jxson/1784669#file-readme-md

## Synopsis

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing. We will split the development of this app in two stages. First, let's talk about stage 1. In this stage you’ll build the core experience of your movies app.

You app will:
-Present the user with a grid arrangement of movie posters upon launch.
-Allow your user to change sort order via a setting:
-The sort order can be by most popular or by highest-rated
-Allow the user to tap on a movie poster and transition to a details screen with additional information such as:
-original title
-movie poster image thumbnail
-A plot synopsis (called overview in the api)
-user rating (called vote_average in the api)
-release date

## Code Example

Show what the library does as concisely as possible, developers should be able to figure out **how** your project solves their problem by looking at the code example. Make sure the API you are showing off is obvious, and that your code is short and concise.

## Motivation

A short description of the motivation behind the creation and maintenance of the project. This should explain **why** the project exists.

## Installation

Provide code examples and explanations of how to get the project.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## Contributors

Let people know how they can dive into the project, include important links to things like issue trackers, irc, twitter accounts if applicable.

## License

A short snippet describing the license (MIT, Apache, etc.)
